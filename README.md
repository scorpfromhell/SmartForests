# SmartForests
## An Internet of Trees to help make Smart Forests that let us conserve wildlife.

Cameratraps provide a wealth of data on wildlife, their behaviours and threats that is otherwise very difficult to gather in person. But they are prone to thefts, especially when left in the field for weeks before being retrieved back.

IoT technologies, especially LoRa, are pretty promising in geofencing without GPS and altering, without GSM, from within the heart of the forests.

We attempt to build an Internet of Trees that are embedded with these IoT devices and thus make the forests smart. Hardware needs to be really hard - not merely be all weather ready, but also be elephant proof! So the housing needs proper thought, design and field testing. The hardware also needs to be sipping energy, barely at that, so that batteries can last weeks between change. The hardware also probably needs to be capable of running machine learning algorithms to identify animals and threats, to alert accordingly. The network topology needs to actually consider the topology of the hilly landscape. We will need to do a lot of experimentation, field testing and course correction. We need to dig in.
